# Bezel.
Bezel. is a landing page built by HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap v4.5
In this site I was dealing with all UI development tools building a fully responsive website.
I used almost all features that Bootstrap framework gives like grid system, components and 
utilities. I also used CSS3 features like media Query in specific pixels to make site fits with all 
screens. Besides I used HTML5 tags.
